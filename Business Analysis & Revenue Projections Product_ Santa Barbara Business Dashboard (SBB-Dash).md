# **Business Analysis & Revenue Projections**

# **Product: Santa Barbara Business Dashboard (SBB-Dash)**

This analysis is based on the PRD v1.0. It is a bottoms-up forecast for a solo founder.

## **1\. Short Answer: The Financial-ROI View**

This is not a billion-dollar unicorn. This is a high-margin, high-value **micro-SaaS** product.

* **Year 1 Realistic Target (MRR):** **\~$3,500 / month**  
* **Total Santa Barbara Market (ARR):** **\~$415,000 / year**  
* **The "Scale" Play:** The *real* value is not in Santa Barbara. It's in creating a *playbook* that you can replicate in 10-15 other "visitor-spend gap" cities (e.g., Ojai, Solvang, Carmel, Aspen).

## **2\. Market Sizing (SAM & SOM)**

This is a niche, B2B product. We must be precise.

* **TAM (Total Addressable Market):** All visitor-serving businesses in California. (Too big, not useful).  
* **SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market):** The *actual* target list. Based on our research, this is the number of independent restaurants, cafes, and retailers in the high-traffic Santa Barbara visitor zones (Downtown, Funk Zone, Waterfront).  
  * **Estimated SAM: \~350 businesses**  
* **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market \- Year 1):** Your realistic target for Year 1\. A 10% penetration of the SAM is an aggressive but achievable goal for a solo founder.  
  * **Year 1 SOM: 35 businesses**

## **3\. Revenue & Pricing Model**

Your value prop is simplicity and solving a direct, $1.9M pain point. The price must be a "no-brainer" for a frustrated shop owner.

* **Proposed Price:** **$99 / month**  
* **Rationale:**  
  * This price is an impulse buy for a business.  
  * It is less than the cost of *one* bad staffing decision (one employee, one 4-hour shift).  
  * It is less than one failed Instagram ad campaign.  
  * If the app saves them from *one* slow weekend they thought would be busy, it pays for itself 3x over.

## **4\. Financial Projections**

### **Year 1 Projection (The "Get Going" Goal)**

This is based on capturing your Year 1 SOM of 35 businesses.

* **Customers:** 35  
* **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR):** 35 \* $99 \= **$3,465**  
* **Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR):** $3,465 \* 12 \= **$41,580**  
* **Cost:** Near $0. Your stack (GitHub Pages, Firebase Functions, Vercel) is free or "pay-as-you-go." This is almost 100% margin.

### **Total Market Worth (The "Santa Barbara" Ceiling)**

This is based on capturing 100% of the SAM (350 businesses).

* **Customers:** 350  
* **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR):** 350 \* $99 \= **$34,650**  
* **Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR):** $34,650 \* 12 \= **$415,800**  
* **Potential Valuation:** A B2B SaaS with these margins can trade at 3-5x ARR. This makes the "Santa Barbara" product alone worth **$1.2M \- $2.0M**.

## **5\. The Real Opportunity: The "Scale" Playbook**

The true value is not the $415k ARR in Santa Barbara. The true value is the **platform and the playbook**.

1. **Prove It (v1.0):** You prove you can get 35 customers in Santa Barbara.  
2. **Productize It (v1.1):** You build the "agentic AI" (per our last discussion) that can ingest *any* city's data (events, TOT, sales tax) and output a forecast.  
3. **Scale It (v2.0):** You spin up new landing pages for other cities with "visitor-spend gaps."

   * solvang-dash.com  
   * carmel-dash.com

If you capture just 35 businesses in 10 different cities, you have built a **$415,800 ARR** solo business.
