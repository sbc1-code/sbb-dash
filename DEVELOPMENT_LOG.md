## Current State Analysis

### What We Have:
- **index.html** - Public landing page with email capture form (currently non-functional)
- **dashboard.html** - Static prototype with hardcoded data showing:
  - 7-Day Demand Forecast (hardcoded)
  - Visitor Insights Chart (Chart.js doughnut chart)
  - Local Promotion Engine (UI only, no backend)
- **Business Analysis document** - Complete market sizing and revenue projections

### What's Missing (To Start Charging $99/mo):
1. Email collection backend (no leads being captured currently)
2. Real data integration for demand forecasting
3. Live TOT/sales tax data for visitor insights
4. Functional promotion engine with database
5. User authentication system
6. Payment/subscription system (Stripe)

## Product Development Strategy - Two Paths Forward

### Option A: "Concierge MVP" (Recommended for Speed)
**Timeline:** Launch in 1-2 weeks
**Approach:** Manual + Automated Hybrid

1. **Week 1:** Build email collection + basic auth + Stripe
2. **Week 2:** Sign up first 5-10 customers at $99/mo
3. **Manually create** weekly forecast reports (Google Sheets + email)
4. **Build automation** while getting paid by early customers
5. **Gradually replace manual work** with automated systems

**Pros:**
- Validate demand immediately
- Start generating revenue in 2 weeks
- Learn what customers actually want
- Build the right features based on feedback

**Cons:**
- Initial manual work (5-10 hours/week)
- Not scalable beyond ~20 customers

---

### Option B: "Full Product First"
**Timeline:** Launch in 6-8 weeks
**Approach:** Build everything before charging

1. **Weeks 1-2:** Data pipeline + forecast engine
2. **Weeks 3-4:** Visitor insights + promotion engine
3. **Weeks 5-6:** Auth + payments + admin panel
4. **Weeks 7-8:** Testing + refinement
5. Launch to beta list

**Pros:**
- Professional, polished product at launch
- Fully automated from day 1
- Scalable immediately

**Cons:**
- 2 months before first dollar
- Risk of building wrong features
- Higher upfront time investment

## Git Workflow Established

```bash
# Working directory
cd /Users/sebastianbecerra/SBusiness

# To make changes and deploy:
git add .
git commit -m "your message here"
git push origin main

# GitHub Pages auto-deploys from main branch
# Live site updates in ~1-2 minutes
```

## Notes for Next Session

- Landing page is live but email form is non-functional (no backend)
- Dashboard is pure frontend prototype with no real data
- Need to decide on MVP strategy before building
- Consider reaching out to 5-10 local businesses to validate demand before building
- SSH key configured and working (Macbook Air M1)
